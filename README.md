## Prerequisites

Before running the project, you'll need the following software and tools installed on your computer:

- R (Programming Language): You can download and install R from the [official website](https://cran.r-project.org/).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MuhammadAnwarBadat/Bellabeat_Smart_Device_Data_Analysis.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd bellabeat-smart-device-analysis

3. Open the R Markdown file `Bellabeat_Smart_Device_Data_Analysis.Rmd` in an R-compatible environment (e.g., RStudio).

4. Run the code cells in the R Markdown document to perform the analysis.

## Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

- `Bellabeat_Smart_Device_Data_Analysis.Rmd`: The main R Markdown document containing the analysis code and explanations.
- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset files as data.zip used for analysis.
- `output/`: This directory stores any output files generated during the analysis.

## Data Sources

The project uses publicly available data from FitBit FitnessTracker Data, which includes minute-level information on physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. You can find the dataset on Kaggle: [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit).

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

In the analysis, we clean, format, and organize the data for further processing. We also perform basic data cleaning steps to ensure the data is ready for analysis.

## Data Analysis

The analysis explores various aspects of the data, including trends in smart device usage, sleep patterns, daily steps, and activity intensities. We use data visualization techniques to present the findings.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

The project concludes with key insights and recommendations for Bellabeat's marketing team. These recommendations are based on the analysis and aim to address areas such as sedentary behavior, sleep improvement, daily step goals, and intensity data.

Feel free to explore the project and adapt the analysis to your needs.
